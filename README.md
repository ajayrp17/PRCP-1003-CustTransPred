# Customer Transaction Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model to help banks identify which customers are likely to make transactions in the future. By analyzing customer data, the model can assist in decision-making and improve business strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various customer features, including transaction history and behavioral attributes. Key preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Model Development
The predictive model was built using machine learning techniques. The steps involved:
1. Data preprocessing (scaling, missing value handling, feature selection)
2. Splitting data into training and testing sets
3. Training models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
4. Evaluating model performance using accuracy and probability scores
5. Selecting the best model based on evaluation metrics

## Challenges Faced
- Missing or incomplete data, requiring imputation and handling techniques
- Feature mismatches between training and test data
- Optimizing model performance for better accuracy

## Results
The final model can predict the likelihood of a customer making a transaction. The results help banks in making informed decisions about customer engagement and financial strategies.

## How to Use
1. Install necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script to train and save the model.
3. Load the saved model and scaler to make predictions on new customer data.

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing feature selection for better accuracy
- Trying advanced machine learning models like XGBoost
- Deploying the model as an API for real-time predictions
